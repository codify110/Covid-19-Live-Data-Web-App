# Covid-19-Live-Data-Web-App
Covid 19 Live Data Web App using Covid-19 Api 
## Intro
I used Coivd 19 Api which is a free api and you don't need to create an account for that. After each time we refresh the data, it will send a new request to Api and it will fetch new updated data and show up in the table. We will be using Javascript to create this webapp. For styling purpose I used bootstrap.
